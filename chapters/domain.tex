\chapter{The \cpo\ Analysis}

In this chapter we present the representation of the abstract domain used for the \cpo\ analysis, alongside the operations that are fundamental for implementing an analysis based on abstract interpretation.
This includes a partial order and the operations \emph{meet}, \emph{join}, \emph{widening} and \emph{narrowing}.
Two different versions of the \emph{join} and of the \emph{equal} operation are introduced,
differing in precision and efficiency.
Finally, the abstract effect of the assignment and the interprocedural analysis of the \cpo\ analysis are discussed.
