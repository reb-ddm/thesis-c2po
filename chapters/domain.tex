\chapter{The \cpo\ Analysis}\label{chapter:analysis}

This chapter presents the fundamental operations of the new domain.
This includes a partial order and the operations \emph{meet}, \emph{join}, \emph{widening} and \emph{narrowing}.
Two different versions of the \emph{join} and of the \emph{equal} operation are introduced,
differing in precision and efficiency.
Finally, the abstract effect of the assignment and the interprocedural analysis of the \cpo\ analysis are discussed.
