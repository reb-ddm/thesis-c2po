\chapter{2-Pointer Logic as an Abstract Domain}\label{chapter:2pointer}

The abstract domain of the \cpo\ analysis consists of finite conjunctions of propositions from the 2-Pointer Logic.
In the following section, we describe this logic and how to represent the propositions to infer all deriving propositions.
Then, we discuss the extension of the domain to include additional terms and the restriction of the domain to a subset of terms, which will be needed later for the analysis.

\textcite{2pointer} introduced the 2-Pointer Logic, which consists of equalities and disequalities between the terms described in \cref{chapter:concrete_semantics}.
Here, we extend this logic with an additional type of proposition, the \emph{block disequalities}.
These disequalities express that two terms do not belong to the same address block.
The propositions $p$ are defined by the following grammar:
\[
  p\,{::=}\,t_1=z+t_2 \mid t_1\neq z+t_2\mid bl(t_1) \neq bl(t_2),
\]
where $*$ denotes the dereferencing operator and $bl(t)$ represents the address block of $t$.
We use $*t$ as an abbreviation for $*(0+t)$ and $x$ as an abbreviation for $*(0+\&x)$.

Moreover, we define the function $bl : \ZZ \rightarrow \Z$ that returns the address block identifier of an address, where $bl(a,b) = a$.
The validity of a proposition under a concrete state $(\rho,\nu,\mu)$ is defined as:
\[
  \begin{array}{ll}
    (\rho,\nu,\mu)\models t_1 = z+t_2          & \textbf{iff}
    \\ \multicolumn{2}{c}{\quad\quad\quad\quad\sem{t_1}\,(\rho,\nu,\mu) = z+\sem{t_2}\,(\rho,\nu,\mu)} Â \\
    (\rho,\nu,\mu)\models t_1 \neq z+t_2       & \textbf{iff}
    \\ \multicolumn{2}{c}{\quad\quad\quad\quad\sem{t_1}\,(\rho,\nu,\mu) \neq z+\sem{t_2}\,(\rho,\nu,\mu)} \\
    (\rho,\nu,\mu)\models bl(t_1) \neq bl(t_2) & \textbf{iff}
    \\ \multicolumn{2}{c}{\quad\quad\quad\quad bl(\sem{t_1}\,(\rho, \nu, \mu)) \neq bl(\sem{t_2}\,(\rho, \nu, \mu))}
  \end{array}
\]

If $(\rho, \nu, \mu)\models p$ for each proposition $p$ in $\Psi$, then we say that $(\rho, \nu, \mu) \models \Psi$.

\section{Kernel Representation of 2-Pointer Logic Conjunctions}

We introduce the \emph{kernel} representation, which groups the quantitative partition, the quantitative automaton, and the two sets of disequalities and block disequalities.
The kernel is the abstract state of the analysis, and it represents the conjunction of propositions that hold in a specific program point, as well as all propositions that they imply.

A \emph{kernel} consists of a tuple $k = \angl{P,M,B,D}$, where $P = (\T, \tau, \omega)$ is a quantitative partition, as described in \cref{subsection:quantitative-union-find}.
Each state of the QFA $M$ represents an equivalence class of $P$, as outlined in \cref{subsection:qfa}.
$B$ and $D$ are sets representing the explicit block and quantitative disequalities, respectively, as detailed in \cref{section:block-disequalities,section:disequalities}.
Given a satisfiable conjunction $\Psi$ of 2-Pointer Logic propositions, the kernel representation of $\Psi$ is denoted as $k[\Psi] = \angl{P[\Psi],M[\Psi],B[\Psi],D[\Psi]}$.
If $\Psi$ is unsatisfiable, the abstract state is represented as $\bot$.

It is possible to convert a kernel representation $k = \angl{P,M,B,D}$ with $M = (S, \otau, \eta, \delta)$ to a formula $\F[k]$, that is given by

\[
  \begin{array}{lll}
    \F[k] & \equiv & \bigwedge_{\eta\,a=(z,s)} (a = z + \otau\,s) \land                            \\
          &        & \bigwedge_{\delta\,z\,s=(z',s')} (*(z + \otau\,s) = z' + \otau\,s') \land     \\
          &        & \bigwedge_{\{t,t'\}\in B} (bl(t) \neq bl(t')) \land \\
          &        & \bigwedge_{(t,z, t') \in D}(t \neq z + t')
  \end{array}
\]

The trivial propositions of the form $t = 0 + t$ are removed from the formula and the repeated equalities.

Given a conjunction $\Psi$ of 2-Pointer Logic propositions, the formula $\F[k[\Psi]]$ is equivalent to $\Psi$, even though it may not be syntactically identical.
The formula $\F[k[\Psi]]$ is not unique for each $\Psi$, as it depends on the choice of representative terms in the quantitative partition and of the set $\T$ of terms.

The domain of \cpo\ consists of all kernels that can be derived from a conjunction of 2-Pointer Logic propositions up to semantic equivalence, as well as the bottom element $\bot$.
The top element of the domain is the kernel $k[true]$.
This element has multiple possible representations, depending on the set $\T$ of chosen terms.
The concretization $\gamma(k)$ of $k$ is the set of all $(\rho, \nu, \mu)$ with $(\rho, \nu, \mu) \models F[k]$.
