\section{Block Disequalities}\label{section:block-disequalities}

The 2-Pointer Logic considers not only equalities but also block and quantitative disequalities between terms.
These are necessary to infer which terms are not
modified when an assignment occurs.
Given a conjunction $\Psi$ of propositions and the corresponding equivalence relation $\equivp$, the block disequalities implied by $\Psi$ can be derived by the following rules:\cite{new-paper-todo}

\begin{enumerate}[label={[B\arabic*]}, ref={[B\arabic*]}]
    \setcounter{enumi}{-1} % to start with B0
    \item If $bl(t_1)\neq bl(t_2)$ then $bl(t_1)\nequivp bl(t_2)$
    \item If $bl(t_1)\nequivp bl(t_2)$ then $bl(t_2)\nequivp bl(t_1)$
          (\emph{symmetry});
          \item\label{item:closure-under-quantitative-equalities}
          If $bl(t_1)\nequivp bl(t_2)$, $t'_1 \equivp z_1+t_1$ and $t'_2\equivp z_2+t_2$, then
          also $bl(t'_1)\nequivp bl(t'_2)$ (\emph{closure under quantitative equalities});
          \item\label{item:distinct-vars-block-neq} $bl(\&x) \neq bl(\&y)$ for all distinct $x, y \in \X$.
\end{enumerate}

The block disequalities are stored as an undirected graph $B$
with edges $\{t_1,t_2\}$ corresponding to conjunctions $bl(t_1) \neq bl(t_2)$,
where $t_1$ and $t_2$ are representative terms in the partition $P[\Psi]$.
It is sufficient to only store the disequalities between representatives, i.e.,
the normalized disequalities $norm_{P[\Psi]}(p)$ because
the block disequalities between other terms are derived from the congruence closure $P[\Psi]$.
The disequalities deriving from rule~\ref{item:distinct-vars-block-neq} are considered as \emph{implicit} block disequalities and are therefore not stored in the set $B[\Psi]$.

If $\Psi$ contains a block disequality $bl(t_1) \neq bl(t_2)$ and for $P[\Psi] = (\T, \tau, \omega)$ it holds that
$\tau\,t_1 \equiv \tau\,t_2$, then the conjunction $\Psi$ is unsatisfiable.

\begin{example}\label{ex:bldiseq}
    Consider the conjunction $\Psi \equiv A = 1 + y \land bl(y) \neq bl(*(1 + y))$.
    The QFA deriving from $\Psi$ is shown in \cref{fig:closure-example}.
    As $\tau\,y = A$ and $\tau\,(*(1+y)) = *A$, the set $B[\Psi]$ would contain the entry $\{A,*A\}$.
\end{example}

\section{Quantitative Disequalities}\label{section:disequalities}

Let $\Psi$ be a conjunction of 2-Pointer Logic terms.
We define the binary relation $\nequivp$ which represents all quantitative disequalities that can be derived from $\Psi$, given the relations $\equivp$ and $bl(\cdot)\nequivp bl(\cdot)$.\cite{new-paper-todo}

\begin{enumerate}[label={[D\arabic*]}, ref={[D\arabic*]}]
    \setcounter{enumi}{-1} % to start with D0
    \item\label{item:neq-quantitative-equalities}
    If $t_1 \neq z + t_2$ occurs in $\Psi$, and $t_1 \equivp z'_1 + t'_1$ and $t_2\equivp z'_2+t'_2$,
    then $t'_1\nequivp (z'_2-z'_1+z)+t'_2$ (\emph{closure under quantitative equalities});
    \item\label{item:neq-quantitative-symmetry} If $t_1 \nequivp z + t_2$, then $t_2 \nequivp -z + t_1$ (\emph{quantitative symmetry});
    %
    \item\label{item:inverse-deref}
    If $*(z_1 + t_1) \nequivp *(z_2 + t_2)$, then $t_1 \nequivp (z_2 - z_1) + t_2$
    (\emph{inverse dereferencing});
    \item\label{item:eq-neq} If $t_1 \equivp z + t_2$, then $t_1\nequivp z'+t_2$ for all $z'\neq z$;
    \item\label{item:block-neq} If $bl(t_1) \nequivp bl(t_2) \in \Psi$, then $t_1 \nequivp z + t_2$ for all $z \in \Z$.
\end{enumerate}

As for the block disequalities, we store a set $D[\Psi]$ of quantitative disequalities between representative terms.
$D[\Psi]$ is a finite weighted directed graph $D$ with edges $(t_1,z,t_2)$ corresponding to all implied
quantitative disequalities $t_1 \nequivp z+t_2$, where $t_1$ and $t_2$ are representative terms in the partition $P[\Psi]$ and
$\{t_1,t_2\}\not\in B$ and at least one
$t_i$ is not an address expression.
The set of disequalities following from rule~\ref{item:eq-neq} and rule~\ref{item:block-neq} can be infinite, but we do not need to explicitly store them, as they implicitly derive from the relations $\equivp$ and $bl(\cdot)\nequivp bl(\cdot)$, which are stored in the partition $P[\Psi]$ and the set $B[\Psi]$.

The list $D[\Psi]$ consists of all quantitative and block disequalities deriving from
\labelcref{item:neq-quantitative-equalities,item:neq-quantitative-symmetry,item:inverse-deref,item:eq-neq,item:block-neq},
but only those that contain representative terms.
This set is finite because we only store equalities between different representatives and not the implicit equalities following from \labelcref{item:eq-neq,item:block-neq}.

Given a set $D$, a disequality $t_1 \nequivp z + t_2$ can be added by:
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $norm_{P[\Psi]}(t_1 \neq z + t_2) \equiv t_1' = z' + t_2'$.
\item If $t_1' \equiv t_2'$ and $z \neq 0$, then it is unsatisfiable.
\item If $t_1'$ and $t_2'$ are both address constants, then the disequality is implicit and not stored in $D$.
\item Otherwise, add $(t_1', z', t_2')$ and $(t_2', -z', t_1')$ to $D$.
\end{itemize}

The disequalities $D = D[\Psi]$ can be computed in polynomial time in the size of the formula $\Psi$ in the following way:

\begin{itemize}
    \item\label{item:diseq-equalities} For each equality $*(z_1 + t_1) \equivp z + *(z_2 + t_2)$ for $z \neq 0$
          that follows from $\Psi$,
          add $t_1 \neq (z_2 - z_1) + t_2$ to $D$, as described before.
    \item\label{item:diseq-bldiseq} For each disequality $bl(*(z_1 + t_1)) \nequivp bl(*(z_2 + t_2))$ that follows from $\Psi$, add $t_1 \neq (z_2 - z_1) + t_2$ to $D$, as described before.
          These two first rules only add a finite amount of disequalities to the set, given that each equality and each block disequality implies at most one disequality of the type $*(z_1 + t_1) \nequivp *(z_2 + t_2)$.
    \item Compute the closure of the quantitative disequalities in $D$ using rule~\labelcref{item:inverse-deref}, and add the normalized disequalities to $D$.
    \item For each disequality $p \in \Psi$, add $norm_{P[\Psi]}(p)$ to $D$.
    \item Again, compute the closure of the disequalities in $D$ using rule~\labelcref{item:inverse-deref}.
\end{itemize}

Given a conjunction $\Psi$, a set $\T$ and the corresponding partition $P = P[\Psi]$, let $p \equiv t_1 \neq z + t_2$ and $norm_{P[\Psi]}(p) = t'_1 \neq z' + t'_2$.
Then
it holds that $\Psi$ implies $p$ if and only if $t_1 \nequivp z + t_2$ and if and only if one of the following holds:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item\label{item:diseqs} $(t_1',z', t_2') \in D[\Psi]$;
    \item\label{item:bl-diseqs} $\{t_1,t_2\} \in B[\Psi]$;
    \item\label{item:eqs} or $t_1 \equivp z' + t_2$ for any $z' \neq z$.
\end{enumerate}
We call the disequalities that follow from \labelcref{item:diseqs}.\ the \emph{explicit} disequalities and those following from \labelcref{item:bl-diseqs}.\ and \labelcref{item:eqs}.\ the \emph{implicit} disequalities.

\begin{example}
    We consider the conjunction from \cref{ex:bldiseq} and add a quantitative disequality.
    Let $\Psi \equiv (A = 1 + y) \land (bl(y) \neq bl(*(1 + y))) \land (\&y \neq 3 + *(1+y)) $.
    The QFA deriving from $\Psi$ is again the one in \cref{fig:closure-example}.
    We can derive the disequality between representatives $\&y \neq 3 + *A$.
    From the block disequality $bl(y) \neq bl(*(1 + y))$ we derive the disequality between representatives $\&y \neq A$ using the rules \labelcref{item:block-neq} and \labelcref{item:inverse-deref}.
    Therefore, $D[\Psi] = (\&y \neq 3 + *A) \land (\&y \neq A)$.
  \end{example}
