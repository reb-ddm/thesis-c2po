Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Prof. Helmut Seidl for his invaluable insights, our stimulating discussions on 2-Pointer Logic, and his thoughtful feedback on the paper.

I am deeply grateful to my supervisor, Julian Erhard, and to Michael Schwarz for their guidance throughout the process of writing this thesis, for giving me the opportunity to publish a related paper and for answering my questions about Goblint.

I am profoundly thankful to my family---especially my parents and sisters---for their unconditional love and constant support, without which this journey would not have been possible.

Finally, I would like to extend my thanks to my friends, with special recognition to Manon and Math√©o, for their encouragement and companionship during this time.
